These scripts are examples of the code used to generate data for our paper "Mendelian randomisation analysis to discover plasma metabolites mediating the effect of obesity on cancer risk" in the British Journal of Cancer. Similar scripts were also used for our paper "Relationship between the microbiome and obesity-associated cancer risk using Mendelian randomisation" in the International Journal of Obesity.

The scripts have been generalised due to, e.g., differences in GWAS summary statistics data formats and whether exposures/outcomes are case/control or quantitative. However, the scripts in this repository should contain all of the required methods to reproduce the results. Please see the paper for details on obtaining the datasets.
